# The Moral Cost of Lying 2020
Data, and Stata/R Replication Code for Duch, Laroze and Zakharov 2021

Lying is widespread, but for many people it entails moral costs. We investigate how these costs depend on the extent of lying. We observe over 1000 individuals from the U.K., Russia and Chile making over 10000 lying decisions, with the payoffs increasing in the extent to which the truth is distorted. We find that both incidence and extent of lying do not depend on the extrinsic benefit of lying. This is not consistent with the moral cost of lying being a smooth, increasing, and concave function of the extent of lying.
